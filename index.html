                <p>
                        I love tech, and I love learning about it. I started to teach myself about programming when I was 14. 
                        It quickly became my favorite hobby. I have been making projects and learning as much as I can in my 
                        free time since then. When I started college, choosing Computer Science as a major was a natural choice. 
                        I started taking on more complex projects and became involved in start-ups, one of which is my own!

                        Ancaona's main product is <a href="http://www.kreyoldict.com/">KreyolDict</a>, an app which combines a standard 
                        dual language (Haitian Creole and English) dictionary along with a social platform where users can 
                        come together to define other language constructs, such as slang, and idioms. KreyolDict is not 
                        released yet and still under active development, but is nearing completion! Anacaona was founded 
                        by myself and my two brothers. As the only technical founder, I am responsible for the majority of 
                        the development.
